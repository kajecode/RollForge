## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-21

### Security

- **fix(deps):** Pin `js-yaml` to `3.14.2` via `pnpm.overrides` —
  resolves GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m (moderate prototype-pollution) reached
  through `gray-matter > js-yaml@3.14.1`. This closes Dependabot alert
  #2 which had been flagging on every push throughout Round 3 (#97)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-21

Final Round-3 milestone ship (M6 Polish). Six grab-bag items. With this
release all 24 Round-3 findings are closed.

### ⚠️ Migration required (Shop unique index)

Existing deployments must drop the old Shop unique index after pulling
this release and before restarting the bot:

```
db.shops.dropIndex("guildId_1_region_1_town_1_name_1")
```

Mongoose will rebuild the index with the new case-insensitive collation
on next connect.

### Added

- **Clickable `/rule` citations** — Documents now have an optional
  `sourceUrl` field, populated from `sourceUrl` or `url` in corpus
  frontmatter during ingest. `/rule` appends a **Sources** footer with
  Discord markdown links (`[Doc Title](<url>)`) when hits carry URLs.
  In-answer `[Doc Title]` mentions from the LLM are left untouched so
  numbering stays familiar (#87)
- **Ingest JSONL run log** — `pnpm ingest` writes one structured JSON
  line per run to `logs/ingest-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` with tokens, USD
  estimate, doc counts, failed paths, and the embed model. Dry-runs
  skip the write. Path configurable via `INGEST_LOG_DIR` env var
  (default `./logs`) (#88)
- **`/session log` modal fallback** — invoking `/session log` without
  both `title` and `note` opens a modal with a title field and
  2000-char paragraph note. Slash-option fast path preserved for
  back-compat (#86)

### Changed

- **Shop unique index** uses case-insensitive collation so
  `"Stonemarket"` and `"stonemarket"` in the same guild/region/town
  correctly collide on the unique constraint (#84). See migration note
  above
- **Prompt templates** hoist their static prefixes into module-level
  `const` strings so OpenAI's prefix cache reliably hits across
  invocations. Dynamic values (tags/seed/type/item) remain strictly
  suffixed (#85)
- **Npcs indexes** — block comment explains why the schema keeps both
  the unique and ci collation indexes on `(guildId, name)`; they serve
  different purposes and cannot be merged (#83)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-21

Fifth Round-3 milestone ship (M5 UX Enhancements). Five issues, shipped
as two PRs. Minor bump — new user-facing features + a log-format change
for operators.

### Added

- **Regenerate + Save buttons on `/shop`.** Ephemeral reply now carries
  a `🔄 Regenerate` button (always) and a `💾 Save` button (when
  `name` was provided). Regenerate re-rolls inventory via
  `generateStock` and edits the embed in place. Save persists the
  currently-displayed stock to the `Shop` collection + corpus
  markdown. Buttons are owner-only (other users get an ephemeral
  "Only the user who ran /shop…" reply) and expire 10 minutes after
  the original reply (#78)
- **Regenerate + Save buttons on `/npc`.** Regenerate re-runs the LLM
  with the original tags and mutates the stored payload so a
  follow-up Save persists the freshly regenerated content. Save
  refuses when no `name` was provided (#79)
- **Regenerate button on `/scene`.** No Save — there is no Scene
  model, and adding one was out of scope for M5. Can be added later
  without breaking the token format (#79)
- **Freeform feedback modal on `/rule` 👎.** Clicking the downvote
  now opens a modal with an optional 1000-char "what was wrong?"
  paragraph textarea. Submit persists the feedback with the comment;
  the 👍 path is unchanged (#80)
- **`/guildconfig view` renders as a Discord embed** with named fields
  (Economy, GM Role, Default Region, Player Channels, Allowed
  Regions, Rarity Overrides). `rarityOverrides` now renders its
  entries correctly on both hydrated and lean paths (previously
  showed `[object Object]` on `.lean()` fetches) (#81)
- **`Feedback.comment`** optional field on the Feedback model for
  storing the 👎 modal textarea (#80)

### Changed

- **Winston file transports emit structured JSON.** `logs/app.log`
  and `logs/error.log` are now one JSON object per line with the
  child meta (`command`, `guildId`, `channelId`, `userId`,
  `subcommand`, `locale`) attached by `loggerForInteraction`
  serialized into each record. Console transport keeps its
  human-readable `printf` format for dev. Discord channel transport
  unaffected. Root logger also sets `defaultMeta: { service:
  "rollforge" }`. **Operators:** any log-shipping pipeline expecting
  the old pretty format needs to be updated (#82)

### Infrastructure

- **`src/core/actionStore.ts`** — new generic token-keyed TTL store
  for pending interaction payloads (shop/npc/scene). Typed by
  discriminant so handlers can peek without pattern-matching on
  payload shape. Background pruner (10-min TTL) wired into the
  `clientReady` handler

## [2.1.5] - 2026-04-18

Fourth Round-3 milestone ship (M4 Ingest Throughput). Single-issue
milestone.

### Added

- **`INGEST_CONCURRENCY`** env var (default `4`). Controls corpus
  ingest parallelism (#72)
- **`.env.example`** now documents `INGEST_CONCURRENCY` and the
  `GUILD_CONFIG_TTL_MS` var from v2.1.3

### Changed

- **Corpus ingest is now parallel.** `pnpm ingest` previously processed
  files strictly serially; each file's OpenAI `batchEmbed` call (200–
  800ms typical) blocked the next file. The new `p-limit(4)` worker
  pool cuts wall-time multi-fold on larger corpora with no risk to
  per-file atomicity — each delete+insert critical section still lives
  inside its own promise with hash-invalidation recovery on failure.
  Tune via `INGEST_CONCURRENCY` (#72)

## [2.1.4] - 2026-04-18

Third Round-3 milestone ship (M3 RAG Quality). Shipped as two PRs but
released together. **After upgrading, run `pnpm ingest` to re-chunk the
corpus** — the new overlap parameters only apply to newly-ingested
chunks.

### Changed

- **RAG chunks now actually overlap.** `simpleChunk` was advertised as
  "~1200-char **overlapping**" in CLAUDE.md and the README since day 1
  but the implementation had always been a plain fixed-width slice with
  zero overlap. Facts that straddled a chunk boundary got split across
  two chunks with no redundancy, hurting both keyword and vector recall
  at boundary positions. Defaults: `maxChars=1200`, `overlap=150` →
  stride 1050, so every chunk shares 150 chars of tail/head with its
  neighbor. Requires `pnpm ingest` after deploy (#71)
- **`$vectorSearch numCandidates`** widened from `Math.max(40, k*8)` to
  `Math.max(150, k*20)`. At the `/rule` hot path (k=6) this grows the
  candidate pool from 48 → 150, aligning with Atlas's recommended 10–
  20× multiplier for HNSW graphs. Cost is all in-Atlas; the bill does
  not scale with numCandidates (#76)
- **`/rule` hybrid-query naming** clarified. Vector and keyword arms
  intentionally receive different query strings (vector = prior turn +
  current for coreference; keyword = current only for literal-term
  relevance). Prior naming hid the intent. Zero behavioral change (#77)

## [2.1.3] - 2026-04-18

Second Round-3 milestone ship (M2 Per-interaction Latency). Six
optimizations to the hot path that runs on every slash command.

### Added

- **`GUILD_CONFIG_TTL_MS`** env var (default `60000`). Tunes the TTL
  for the new GuildConfig read-through cache (#67)

### Changed

- **GuildConfig** is now cached with a 60s TTL. Every slash command
  that reads guild state (`/rule`, `/shop`, `/price`, `/npc`, `/scene`,
  `/shops`, `/session`) saves one Mongo RTT per invocation after the
  first hit. `/guildconfig` writes invalidate the cache on the spot
  so next-command reads see fresh state (#67)
- **`/rule`** runs `embed()` and `visibilityForInteraction()` in
  parallel instead of sequentially, saving one network-bound await
  per rule lookup (#68)
- **`stockGenerator`** runs the local + global `Item.find` candidate
  queries in parallel when a region is supplied, halving p50 shop
  generation latency on region-scoped calls (#69)
- **`/price`** projects only the fields the renderer reads and uses
  `.lean()` on both `findOne` paths instead of hydrating the full
  Mongoose document (#73)
- **`/session list`** uses an aggregate with `$project + $size` so
  full notes arrays are no longer shipped over the wire just to
  render a one-line summary per session (#74)
- **`/npc` link mode** replaces two parallel preflight `findOne` calls
  with a single projected `.find({ name: $in })` that still identifies
  exactly which NPC(s) are missing (#75)

## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-18

First Round-3 milestone ship (M1 Correctness). Three latent bugs that
slipped past the first two audit passes.

### Fixed

- **`/guildconfig set region:<slug>`** now actually persists. Previously
  wrote to a non-existent `defaultRegion` field, so every consumer
  silently ignored the value. Now writes to `defaultRegionTag` in the
  schema-documented `"region:<slug>"` format and validates the slug
  against `Regions` before writing (#65)
- **`/shop` region validation** standardized on slug. Previously the
  command validated by `name` while `generateStock` resolved by `slug`,
  so regions with `name != slug` failed one of the two checks. The
  region autocomplete now submits the slug as the option value while
  still displaying the friendly name (#66)
- **`DiscordChannelTransport`** surfaces send failures. The empty
  `catch (_) {}` that silently swallowed every Discord send error has
  been replaced with a first-failure-to-stderr + 60s suppression window,
  so misconfigured error channels are no longer invisible (#70)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-18

### Security

- **fix(deps):** Resolve 8 high-severity CVEs via dependency upgrades and
  pnpm overrides (#64)

### Fixed

- **PM2 ecosystem config** corrected so `pnpm start` launches the bot
  under PM2 as expected

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-12

First release after the 26-finding code review + Atlas diagnostic + second-pass
audit. 37 PRs shipped across 3 days. Test suite grew from 62 to 224 tests.

### Added

- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions: lint → format:check → build → test on every
  push to main and every PR (#20)
- **ESLint + Prettier** — flat-config ESLint with @typescript-eslint, Prettier at
  100-col, CI-gated (#21)
- **Release workflow** — tag-triggered GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
- **`pnpm ingest:dry-run`** — preview token count and estimated cost without
  calling OpenAI or writing to the DB (#11)
- **`pnpm validate:atlas`** — drift detector comparing committed Atlas Search
  index JSONs against the live cluster (#44, #45)
- **`/guildconfig settlement`** — per-guild override for shop stocking rules
  (gpCap, itemsMin, itemsMax per settlement size) (#24)
- **`/session forget`** — removes a session + its ingested RAG document and
  chunks, with prune-skip so `pnpm ingest --prune` doesn't delete session
  entries (#19)
- **Blackmarket split knobs** — `blackmarketPriceMultiplier` and
  `blackmarketAvailabilityMultiplier` in GuildConfig.economy, independently
  tunable; legacy `blackmarketMultiplier` still works as a fallback (#17)
- **Ingest cost summary** — `batchEmbed` now returns `{ vectors, tokens }`;
  ingest prints a per-run summary with token count and estimated USD (#11)
- **Ingest failure tracking** — failed files listed by path in the summary (#61)
- **Ingest dim-drift self-healing** — re-embeds chunks whose dimension doesn't
  match `EMBED_DIM` when the content hash is unchanged, so switching embedding
  models is self-healing on the next `pnpm ingest` (#46)
- **Atlas Search index definitions** committed under `infra/atlas-search/` for
  versioned provisioning (#10)
- **`scripts/diagnose-rag.mjs`** — live diagnostic testing `$vectorSearch`,
  legacy `knnBeta`, and keyword `$search` against the cluster (#46)
- **`mapGet` / `mapHas` / `mapEntries`** helpers for Mongoose Map fields that
  work on both hydrated docs and `.lean()` results (#16)
- **224 tests across 23 files** — up from 62 tests / 4 files. Every command
  handler, the pricing pipeline, RAG, visibility, stockGenerator, weights,
  conversation history, embedding, autocomplete, session, ingest path tagging,
  and the mapLike utility are now covered.

### Fixed

- **Vector search restored** — 191 of 194 chunks were orphaned at 3072 dims
  against a 1536-dim Atlas index after a silent `MODEL_EMBED` switch. Re-ingested
  at the correct dimension; `/rule` now returns vector-ranked results (#46)
- **handleFeedback ack** — `deferUpdate()` before `Feedback.create()` to satisfy
  Discord's 3s interaction deadline (#1)
- **Silent `.catch(() => {})`** swallows in the interaction dispatcher replaced
  with logged handlers (#2)
- **Prompt injection** — `/rule` query capped at 500 chars, sanitized for
  control/zero-width characters, system prompt hardened against context-as-
  instruction attacks (#3)
- **`unhandledRejection` + `uncaughtException`** — both handlers now guard the
  logger and exit so PM2 can restart (#4)
- **Unknown region slug** in `/shop` now throws early with a friendly error
  instead of silently generating a global-pool shop (#5)
- **Visibility cfg lookup failure** logged at warn instead of silently defaulting
  to player-level (#6)
- **`hybridSearch` k clamped** at both ends (max 20 merged, 30 vec, 60 kw) to
  prevent unbounded memory growth (#7)
- **`/rule` answer length** capped at 4000 chars + max 3 Discord messages (#8)
- **Materials N+1** — `buildMaterialCache` batch-loads materials with a single
  `find({ slug: { $in } })` instead of per-candidate `findOne` (#9)
- **Chunks visibility index** added for the keyword-search `$match` stage (#10)
- **Conversation history** background pruner on a timer + 10k-entry LRU cap (#12)
- **Autocomplete** — collation indexes + anchored escaped prefix regex on every
  searchable field; prevents full collection scans on every keystroke (#13)
- **Mongoose connection pool** — explicit `maxPoolSize`, `minPoolSize`,
  `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`, `socketTimeoutMS` (#14)
- **`weightedSample`** falls back to uniform sampling when all weights are zero
  instead of returning an empty array (#15)
- **Lean Map dual-access** patterns replaced with `mapGet` helper; also fixed a
  latent bug where `materialOverrides` guild overrides were broken for both
  hydrated and lean docs (#16)
- **Shop corpus files** scoped under `corpus/guilds/<guildId>/` to prevent
  cross-guild overwrites on ingest (#18)
- **`Regions.path = "FIXME"`** literal replaced with a throw (#23)
- **Autocomplete `.toString()`** replaced with safe `String(... ?? "")` + 100-
  char cap (#25)
- **Mongoose `{ new: true }`** deprecation warnings eliminated by switching to
  `{ returnDocument: "after" }` across all 11 call sites (#57)
- **`Materials.regionSlugs`** schema fixed from `String` to `[String]` — was
  silently treating every material as non-local (#60)
- **NPC relation linking** — two sequential `updateOne` calls replaced with a
  single atomic pipeline update (#60)
- **`applyEconomy`** return type fixed from `any` to `number | null | undefined`
  (#60)
- **Ingest chunk insert recovery** — on `insertMany` failure after `deleteMany`,
  the content hash is invalidated so the next run retries (#60)
- **StockSchema / SpecialItemSchema** subdocument fields now have `required`,
  `min`, `enum`, and `default` constraints (#61)
- **LLM error handling** in `/scene`, `/npc`, `/price` — contextual error
  messages instead of the generic "Something went wrong" (#61)
- **Dead code removed** — unused `categoryMap.ts` and `priceTables.ts` (#60)

### Changed

- **`pricing.ts`** split from a 316-line monolith into 7 focused modules under
  `src/services/pricing/` with a 27-line barrel re-export (#23)
- **`src/config/env.ts`** defaults updated: `MODEL_EMBED` →
  `text-embedding-3-small`, `EMBED_DIM` → `1536` (#46)
- **Atlas Search JSONs** rewritten to match the live cluster's legacy
  `type:search` + `knnVector` shape at 1536 dims (#46)
